This is only a short info about compliation and execution of GRPY program.
For more detailed information please refer to the user manual.

1) Compilation of single cpu version:

  i) For Linux users
  
     to compile run:
         make -f Makefile linux
     
     to clean compilation run:
         make -f Makefile clean
  
     the executable will compile to
         bin/GRPY
  
  ii) For Windows users
  
     there are precompiled version in
         bin/GRPYWindows_x86
         bin/GRPYWindows_x64

2) Compilation of multi cpu version (using PLASMA library http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma/software/):

  i) For Linux users
  
     a) provide PLASMA library. 
         It can be installed from included ThirdParty folder
         Best performance is achieved with machine optimised PLAMSA library (please refer to PLASMA library README file).
         The library can be installed from scratch with reference components by executing
             cd ThirdParty/ThirdParty/plasma-installer_2.8.0
             ./setup.py --cc=gcc --fc=gfortran --downblas
  
     b) compile plasmaGRPY program
         to compile run:
             make -f Makefile linux
         
         to clean compilation run:
             make -f Makefile clean
         
         the executable will compile to
             bin/plasmaGRPY
  
3) Execution - this program is a console application for Linux and Windows users

  i) single cpu version

    a) GRPY iput file
        <path to GRPY executable> <path to input file>
    
    b) hydro++ input file
        <path to GRPY executable> -d <path to input control file>

    c) us-somo .bead_model file
        <path to GRPY executable> -u <path to input file>

  ii) On linux plasmaGRPY can be used to run the code in parallel.
      In order to do so a number of cores can be passed to the plasmaGRPY program with system variable CORE_NUM
        export CORE_NUM=<n>
      where n is the number of cores to be used by PLASMA library.
      Then the program can be executed as

    a) GRPY iput file
        <path to plasmaGRPY executable> <path to input file>
    
    b) hydro++ input file
        <path to plasmaGRPY executable> -d <path to input control file>

    c) us-somo .bead_model file
        <path to plasmaGRPY executable> -u <path to input file>

4) REMARKS
  i) the prgram has a limited input file lenght thus it is most robust to execute it from the input file folder
