In this folder we provide the set of structure that were used to create data for publication

GRPY - an accurate bead method for calculation of hydrodynamic properties of rigid biomacromolecules
Zuk, Cichocki, Szymczak, Biophysical Journal 2018

Folder contains:
-->  folders named as pdb structure with a possible prefix
       1) no prefix  - monomeric molecules from Xray
       2) dim prefix - multimeric molecules from Xray
       3) avg prefix - average structure calculated from complete pdb entry from NMR
       4) fst prefix - first structure from complete pdb entry from NMR
     most folders should contain
       1) original pdb entry
       2) name      - file including human readable name of the structure
       3) specVmw   - file including specific volume and molecular weight
       4) expD, expEta, expTau - file containing normalized (to the best of our knowledge)
                                 experimental values and citations explained in the bibtex file
       5) various hydrodynamic input files for GRPY, SOMO, ZENO, HYDRO++, HYDROPRO
                                 programs
       6) various hydrodynamic output files for GRPY, SOMO, ZENO, HYDRO++, HYDROPRO
                                 programs
-->  files to organize the data
       1) harvestData files - bash scripts that scan folders and generate Data files
                              with deviations from experimental values
       2) makeTable files   - python scripts that generate data rows for tables present
                              in the publication
       3) citationsLib.bib  - bibtex file explaining citations
       4) files converting data between various formats with meaningful names
                              These files may contain links to other external programs
                              that are needed to perform the conversions however all
                              of them should be freely available.
